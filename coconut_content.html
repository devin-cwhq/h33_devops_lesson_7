<h3>Coconut</h3>

<p>Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only living species of the genus Cocos. The term "coconut" can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut.</p>

<p>Coconut palms are found in tropical coastal areas nearly worldwide and are cultivated in more than 80 countries. They can grow up to 30 meters tall and live for up to 150 years. The coconut provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses.</p>
