<h3>Arecaceae</h3>

<p>The Arecaceae (/ˌærəˈkeɪsi.iː, -ˌaɪ/) are a family of perennial, flowering plants in the monocot order Arecales. Their growth form can be climbers, shrubs, tree-like and stemless plants, all commonly known as palms.</p>

<p>Those having a tree-like form are colloquially called palm trees.[4] Currently, 181 genera with around 2,600 species are known,[5][6] most of which are restricted to tropical and subtropical climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem, except for the Hyphaene genus, which has branched palms.</p>
