<h3>Ebony</h3>

<p>Ebony is a dense black/brown hardwood, coming from several species in the genus Diospyros, which also includes the persimmon tree. </p>

<p>Ebony is finely textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it valuable as an ornamental wood. The better known Fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is the most commonly cultivated.</p>
